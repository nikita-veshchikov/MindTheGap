\begin{abstract}
Software-based cryptographic implementations are vulnerable to side-channel analysis. 
Implementors often opt for masking countermeasures, to protect against these types of attacks.
Masking countermeasures ensure theoretical protection against value-based leakages. However, the practical effectiveness of masking is halted by 
physical effects such as glitches and distance-based leakages, which violate the \emph{independent leakage assumption} (ILA) and result in security order reductions. This paper aims to address this gap between masking theory and practice in the following threefold manner. First, we perform an in-depth investigation of the device-specific effects that invalidate ILA in the AVR microcontroller ATMega163. Second, we provide an automated tool, capable of detecting ILA violations in AVR assembly code. Last, we craft the first (to our knowledge) \emph{``hardened''} 1st-order ISW-based, masked Sbox implementation, which is capable of resisting 1st-order, univariate side-channel attacks. Enforcing the ILA in the masked RECTANGLE Sbox requires $<>$\todo{add number of cycles} clock cycles, i.e. a $<>$-fold increase compared  to a naive 1st-order ISW-based implementation.
